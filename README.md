## ðŸ’¡ Tips
- Do not overmix the dough to keep scones light and fluffy.  
- For extra contrast, twist or fold the two dough colors to create marbling.  
- Scones are best eaten the same day but can be lightly toasted the next day.  
- Experiment with flavors: chocolate and vanilla, strawberry and cream, or matcha and plain.
